At which step of the workflow for booking a car reservation (create quote, collect quotes,
confirm) would the indirect communication between objects or components kick in?

Indirect communication kicks in when users confirm quotes. 
This communication happens in ConfirmQuotesServlet, which enqueues a task. 
This task is then assigned to a worker. The communication is indirect, 
since the worker may be assigned the task at any later time.


Which kind of data is passed between both sides? Does it make sense to persist data and
only pass references to that data?

Only tasks (containing lists of quotes users want to confirm) are passed between both sides. 
More specifically, they are only sent from the front-end to the back-end.
